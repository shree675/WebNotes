# WebNotes

## About
WebNotes is a Chrome extension that lets you add notes to highlighted text in almost all of the websites. These notes can be individually saved, edited or deleted.

The text to which a note is added appears in a clickable light-purple highlight. Click on the highlight to expand/collapse notes.
