## About
WebNotes is a Chrome extension that lets you add notes to highlighted text in almost all of the websites. These notes can be individually saved, edited or deleted.

The text to which a note is added appears in a clickable light-purple highlight. Click on the highlight to expand/collapse notes. All features are provided in a simplistic and convenient manner.

These notes are saved to the user's Google account if sync is enabled. Otherwise, they are stored in the local storage of the browser in the specific machine.
